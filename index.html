    <h2><u>I....</u></h2>
    <p>I'm a hard-working,passionate,enthusiastic and a curious person with a great character.</p>
    <p>I love to travel and explore different places and meet different personalities and know about them.</p>
    <p>I don't wanna live a normal middle-class life,nor do i wish to just become rich and live a boring life.</p>
    <p>I want to achieve something beyond my imaginations.</p>

    <h2><u>AT THE MOMENT....</u></h2>
    <p>Now at this particular moment while creating my first website, I'm a first year undergratuate at <a href="https://web.mitsgwalior.in/">MITS-GWL</a>  pursuing Btech in IT.</p>
    <p>Well to be honest, I don't like anything about the college here.Nor do I like this city anymore.</p>
    <p><b><i>I really miss My City and all my school-friends.I used to say that before but now I realize that there can never be a replacement for my brothers Daksh,Dev,Karan,Shrijit and Harsh!</i></b></p>
    <p>I also used to get a bit sad at times as I couldn't find anyone like myself over here.<i><b>Ya ya, I know that I'm one of My Kind in the Whole Multiverse😉</b></i></p>
    <p>But, as they say: <i>"GIVE TIME SOME TIME,AND EVERYTHING STARTS GETTING NORMAL."</p>
    <p>It turns out to be true in my case also as ,Now I have made some Good friends over here like Anurag,Sachin,Keshav and many more who'll be connected with me throughout this college journey and even beyond it.</p></i>
    <p><b>AND RATHER THAN JUST STRESSING ON ALMOST EVERYTHING; I'VE STARTED ACCEPTING THINGS AS THEY ARE!<br></p><p><i>!ALL THE MORE I'VE STARTED BEING MYSELF!</i></b>
